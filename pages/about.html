                <h2>The Journey</h2>
                <p class="story-lead">
                    In the early 1980s, a young girl walked into a skatepark filled with boys and changed the course of
                    action sports forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Cara-Beth Burnside, but most know me as CB. My path wasn't just about landing tricks or winning
                    competitions – it was about proving that passion and determination know no gender boundaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I started skating, there were no female role models, no women's divisions, and certainly no
                    expectation that a girl could go pro. But I didn't see obstacles; I saw opportunities. Every "you
                    can't" became fuel for my "watch me."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, after decades of pushing boundaries in both skateboarding and snowboarding, I've transitioned
                    from competing to cultivating the next generation of game-changers. Because breaking barriers isn't
                    just about personal achievement – it's about holding the door open for those who come after.

                        Excellence isn't just about perfecting tricks – it's about developing the complete athlete.

                            <p>Every movement has a purpose. I break down complex tricks into achievable progressions,
                                focusing on form, timing, and the physics that make the impossible possible.</p>

                            <p>The biggest obstacles aren't in the skatepark – they're in your mind. I teach athletes to
                                conquer fear, visualize success, and develop the resilience that separates pros from
                                amateurs.</p>

                                securing sponsorships to navigating competitions and building a lasting legacy.</p>

                            I've won the medals, earned the magazine covers, and proven what's possible. But my greatest
                            achievement isn't what I've done – it's what I can help others do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every athlete I work with carries the potential to redefine what's possible in
                            skateboarding. My role isn't to create carbon copies of my success; it's to unlock each
                            skater's unique greatness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I see a young skater land their first big trick, overcome their fears, or sign their
                            first sponsorship deal, I'm reminded why this next chapter of my journey is the most
                            important one yet.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "The future of skateboarding isn't just about bigger tricks or higher scores. It's about
                            athletes who understand their power to inspire, innovate, and elevate the entire sport.
                            That's who I'm here to develop."
